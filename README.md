# Daedalus

Daedalus |ˈdedl-əs| Greek Mythology
  a craftsman, considered the inventor of carpentry, who is said to have
  built the labyrinth for Minos, king of Crete. Minos imprisoned him and
  his son Icarus, but they escaped using wings that Daedalus made and
  fastened with wax. Icarus, however, flew too near the sun and was killed.


In other words, he built things for a living.

Daedalus is an extraction from the Rubinius build system. Very few of the
features have been implemented at this point. It is very very alpha.
